Inspiration:  After traveling to a few different countries and living abroad for a few years, I have always wondered what life is like in over places. I also wondered what how life in a different city compared to life in my current location. 

Summary: An app to help users see the quality of life based on their current location or a selected city, by accessing the Teleport API to get city scores based on 17 categories : 
Housing	,Cost of Living	,Startups, Venture Capital, Travel Connectivity, Commute, Business Freedom, Safety, Healthcare, Education, Environmental, Economy, Taxation, Internet Access, Leisure & Culture, Tolerance, Outdoors. 

Users will then be able to compare their initial search with other city from a dropdown menu. The data will appear on a table with both scores for each category, there will also be a column that shows the percent differnce between the compared city and the initial city. 

Technology used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
